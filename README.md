# Portfolio-Website
I have created this Portfolio website as my Web technology course end project. Although the website looks extremely attractive and professional, I wasn't able to make my certificates section the way I wanted, it was supposed to be displayed as a grid and be sorted. Apart from that issue, everything else is up to the mark.
